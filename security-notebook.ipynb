My project showcases below genAI capabilities:\n\n- Function calling,\n- Embeddings,\n- and Retrieval augmented generation (RAG).\n\nIn this notebook, I will cover tasks that are often required when working in Security Operations Center, especially in companies like Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs).\nEveryday, MSSPs need to deal with huge number of security events and alerts for multiple clients' environments. Of course, this could be a benefit, considering they can observe different threat scenarios for various clients and essentially learn about possible attack surfaces thanks to vast amount of data.\nAnd when there is a big data, there could be a good opportunity for machine learning or generative AI models. We already observe such trend in public, that ML or AI components are embedded in security tools like EDRs or SIEMs. However, it also brings an obstacle - which is a privacy of such data. Nobody would want their security alerts to be used in training of models that could be leveraged in public.\n\nFor this notebook I used [\"Microsoft Security Incident Prediction\" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Microsoft/microsoft-security-incident-prediction) which ensures privacy by implementing stringent anonymization process in which sensitive values are pseudo-anonymized using SHA1 hashing techniques. Moreover those hashes were replaced by randomly generated IDs to further enhance anonymity and prevent any potential re-identification. With such cured data we verify generative AI capabilities whilst privacy is kept.\n\nMoreover, as part of this project, I wanted to show how genAI tools could be leveraged in another part of security operations which is threat hunting. In the presented case, I showed how genAI models could enhance capabilities of security teams by combining internal knowledge base with external OSINT resources.\n\n**For this project I used Google's Gemini models.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Creating notebook**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Considering that it was my first notebook on Kaggle platform, I will also share some steps that I did to begin this project.\n\nI started by navigating to the above dataset [\"Microsoft Security Incident Prediction\" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Microsoft/microsoft-security-incident-prediction) and clicked on \"three dots\" menu.

With an intimate knowledge of enterprise information technology, this threat group presents a significant risk even to organizations with well-developed legacy cyber defenses. Muddled Libra’s tactics can be fluid, adapting quickly to a target environment. They continue to use social engineering as their primary modus operandi, targeting a company's IT help support desk. For example, in under a few minutes, these threat actors successfully changed an account password and later reset the victim’s MFA to gain access to their networks. Muddled Libra was first noted for targeting organizations in the software automation, outsourcing and telecommunications verticals. Since then, they’ve expanded their targeting to include the technology, business process outsourcing, hospitality and more recently, financial industries. They show no signs of slowing. Unit 42 researchers and responders have investigated interrelated incidents from mid-2022 through the beginning of 2024, which we’ve attributed to the threat group Muddled Libra. Initial attacks were highly structured and favored large business process outsourcing firms serving high-value cryptocurrency holders. We believe that when the threat actors exhausted those targets, they evolved into a ransomware affiliate model with extortion as their key objective. In the cases we’ve been involved with, we observed Muddled Libra performing the following activities:     Using NSOCKS and TrueSocks proxy services     Creating email rules to forward emails from specific security vendors to the actors to monitor communications and those helping in the investigation     Deploying a custom virtual machine into the environment     Using an open-source rootkit, bedevil (bdvl) to target VMware vCenter servers     Gaining administrative permissions     Heavy use of anonymizing proxy services We also believe that members of Muddled Libra speak English as a first language, which provides them greater ability to conduct their social engineering attacks with other English speakers. Muddled Libra has also been observed using AI to spoof victims’ voices. Social media videos can be used by attackers to train AI models. The targets we’ve observed seem to be primarily in the U.S. Thwarting Muddled Libra requires interweaving tight security controls, diligent awareness training and vigilant monitoring. Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats described in this article through a modern security architecture built around Cortex XSIAM in concert with Cortex XDR. The Advanced URL Filtering and DNS Security Cloud-Delivered Security Services can help protect against command and control (C2) infrastructure, while App-ID can limit anonymization services allowed to connect to the network. # Threat Overview - The attack style defining Muddled Libra appeared on the cybersecurity radar in late 2022 with the release of the 0ktapus phishing kit. This malware kit offered the following features:     A prebuilt hosting framework     Easy C2 connectivity     Bundled attack templates These options allowed attackers to emulate mobile authentication pages cheaply and easily. With over 200 realistic fake authentication portals and some targeted smishing, attackers quickly gathered credentials and multifactor authentication (MFA) codes for over one hundred organizations. The speed and breadth of these attacks caught many defenders off-guard. While smishing is not a new tactic, the 0ktapus framework commoditized what would typically require complex infrastructure and advanced technical skills, in a way that granted even low-skilled attackers a high attack success rate. The sheer number of targets being hit with this kit created a fair amount of confusion regarding attribution in the research community. Previous reporting by Group-IB, CrowdStrike and Okta has documented and mapped many of these attacks to the following intrusion groups: 0ktapus, Scattered Spider and Scatter Swine. While these have been frequently treated as several names for one group, what these names actually define are:     An attack style using a common toolkit     A social forum-based collaboration network     An Agile-like team structure Muddled Libra is a distinct group of actors using this tradecraft. In a 2023 blog posted on ALPHV’s leak site, the attackers corroborated this view, claiming that previous researcher attribution models have been non-specific. During Unit 42 Incident Response investigations, we identified several cases we attribute to Muddled Libra. Muddled Libra has been responsible for a campaign of complex supply chain attacks, ultimately leading to high-value cryptocurrency targets. This group has only intensified their campaign. They are shifting tactics to adapt to improving cyber defenses, and they are targeting to broaden their attack scope.\" \n\n#source: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/scattered-spider.html \ndocument2 = \"What is Scattered Spider? Scattered Spider is a financially motivated threat actor group founded in May 2022. The group is thought to comprise operatives based in the United States and the United Kingdom. They are believed to be primarily between the ages of 19 and 22. How they hack The group is considered expert in social engineering and uses multiple techniques — including phishing, push bombing, and subscriber identity module (SIM) swap attacks — in order to obtain credentials, install remote access tools, and/or bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA). According to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Scattered Spider uses tools like:     Fleetdeck.io and Level.io to enable remote monitoring and management of systems     Screenconnect and Splashtop to enable remote connections to network devices     Tailscale to provide virtual private networks (VPN) to secure network communications  They also use malware like AveMaria, Raccoon Stealer, and VIDAR Stealer. To begin their phishing attempts, the group creates victim-specific domains, such as victimname-sso[.]com, victimname-servicedesk[.]com, and victimname-okta[.]com.  Known aliases Scattered Spider is also referred to as Starfraud, UNC3944, Scatter Swine, and Muddled Libra. Known attacks The group, whose name was first tagged by cybersecurity researchers, gained notoriety for hacking Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International, two of the largest casino and gambling companies in the United States, in September 2023. It’s possible that Scattered Spider was assisted by the group ALPHV/BlackCat. MGM shut down systems across all of its 31 resorts, while Caesars tried avoiding a shutdown by paying the group $15 million.  Reuters reported that Scattered Spider obtained six terabytes (6TB) of stolen data from the hotels and casinos, including sensitive information about the millions of guests who have stayed there.  Their way in? Posing as an MGM employee and calling an IT help desk to “recover their password.” Scattered Spider has also attacked other organizations by posing as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to:     Obtain credentials from employees and gain access to the network     Direct employees to run commercial remote access tools enabling initial access     Convince employees to share their one-time password (OTP)     Send repeated MFA notification prompts leading to employees pressing the “Accept” button (also known as MFA fatigue)  They’ve even successfully convinced cellular carriers to transfer control of a targeted user’s phone number to a SIM card, gaining control over the phone and access to MFA prompts. Worse, they’ve monetized access to victim networks in numerous ways including extortion enabled by ransomware and data theft.\"\n\n#source:  https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-320a\ndocument3 =\"This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 14.

Overview Scattered Spider (also known as Starfraud, UNC3944, Scatter Swine, and Muddled Libra) engages in data extortion and several other criminal activities. Scattered Spider threat actors are considered experts in social engineering and use multiple social engineering techniques, especially phishing, push bombing, and subscriber identity module (SIM) swap attacks, to obtain credentials, install remote access tools, and/or bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA). According to public reporting, Scattered Spider threat actors have: Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain credentials from employees and gain access to the network [T1598],[T1656]. Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff to direct employees to run commercial remote access tools enabling initial access [T1204],[T1219],[T1566]. Posed as IT staff to convince employees to share their one-time password (OTP), an MFA authentication code. Sent repeated MFA notification prompts leading to employees pressing the “Accept” button (also known as MFA fatigue) [T1621]. Convinced cellular carriers to transfer control of a targeted user’s phone number to a SIM card they controlled, gaining control over the phone and access to MFA prompts. Monetized access to victim networks in numerous ways including extortion enabled by ransomware and data theft [T1657]. After gaining access to networks, the FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors using publicly available, legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Table 1 details a list of legitimate tools Scattered Spider, repurposed and used for their criminal activity. Note: The use of these legitimate tools alone is not indicative of criminal activity. Users should review the Scattered Spider indicators of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs discussed in this CSA to determine whether they have been compromised. Table 1: Legitimate Tools Used by Scattered Spider Tool \tIntended Use Fleetdeck.io \tEnables remote monitoring and management of systems.

VIDAR Stealer \tSteals information including login credentials, browser history, cookies, and other data. Scattered Spider threat actors have historically evaded detection on target networks by using living off the land techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate victim networks, as well as frequently modifying their TTPs. Observably, Scattered Spider threat actors have exfiltrated data [TA0010] after gaining access and threatened to release it without deploying ransomware; this includes exfiltration to multiple sites including U.S.-based data centers and MEGA[.]NZ [T1567.002]. Recent Scattered Spider TTPs New TTP - File Encryption More recently, the FBI has identified Scattered Spider threat actors now encrypting victim files after exfiltration [T1486]. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors communicate with victims via TOR, Tox, email, or encrypted applications. Reconnaissance, Resource Development, and Initial Access Scattered Spider intrusions often begin with broad phishing [T1566] and smishing [T1660] attempts against a target using victim-specific crafted domains, such as the domains listed in Table 3 [T1583.001]. Table 3: Domains Used by Scattered Spider Threat Actors Domains victimname-sso[.]com victimname-servicedesk[.]com victimname-okta[.]com In most instances, Scattered Spider threat actors conduct SIM swapping attacks against users that respond to the phishing/smishing attempt. The threat actors then work to identify the personally identifiable information (PII) of the most valuable users that succumbed to the phishing/smishing, obtaining answers for those users’ security questions. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII [T1589 ], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use social engineering techniques [T1656] to convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens [T1078.002],[T1199],[T1566.004] to perform account takeovers against the users in single sign-on (SSO) environments. Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006],[T1606] after compromising a user’s account to establish persistence [TA0003]. Further, the threat actors add a federated identity provider to the victim’s SSO tenant and activate automatic account linking [T1484.002]. The threat actors are then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO account attribute. At this stage, the Scattered Spider threat actors already control the identity provider and then can choose an arbitrary value for this account attribute. As a result, this activity allows the threat actors to perform privileged escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords are changed [T1078]. Additionally, they leverage common endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools installed on the victim networks to take advantage of the tools’ remote-shell capabilities and executing of commands which elevates their access. They also deploy remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools [T1219] to then maintain persistence. Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration Once persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation [T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging into Virtual Private Networks (VPN) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the victim’s Active Directory (AD), perform discovery and exfiltration of victim’s code repositories [T1213.003], code-signing certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083],[TA0010]. Threat actors activate Amazon Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral movement [TA0007],[TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002] Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. In instances where the ultimate goal is data exfiltration, Scattered Spider threat actors use actor-installed extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools [T1648] to bring data from multiple data sources into a centralized database [T1074],[T1530]. According to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat actors may have deployed BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware onto victim networks—thereby encrypting VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486]. To determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider threat actors often search the victim’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actor’s intrusion and any security response. The threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in response to victim defenses. This is sometimes achieved by creating new identities in the environment [T1136] and is often upheld with fake social media profiles [T1585.001] to backstop newly created identities.\"\n\ndocuments = [document1, document2, document3]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T14:34:29.065672Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T14:34:29.066487Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T14:34:29.072900Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-18T14:34:29.066446Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T14:34:29.071624Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have the resources ready, now we will define the embedding function with usage of `text-embedding-004` model via Gemini API  that will help us prepare embeddings of those OSINT resources and later on of the given user's query.\n\nIn the below function we have a switch `document_mode` that will help us easily change the embedding task for the model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define a helper to retry when per-minute quota is reached.\nis_retriable = lambda e: (isinstance(e, genai.errors.APIError) and e.code in {429, 503})\n\n\nclass GeminiEmbeddingFunction(EmbeddingFunction):\n    # Specify whether to generate embeddings for documents, or queries\n    document_mode = True\n\n    @retry.Retry(predicate=is_retriable)\n    def __call__(self, input: Documents) -> Embeddings:\n        if self.document_mode:\n            embedding_task = \"retrieval_document\"\n        else:\n            embedding_task = \"retrieval_query\"\n\n        response = client.models.embed_content(\n            model=\"models/text-embedding-004\",\n            contents=input,\n            config=types.EmbedContentConfig(\n                task_type=embedding_task,\n            ),\n        )\n        return [e.values for e in response.embeddings]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T14:34:53.799838Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T14:34:53.800282Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T14:34:53.807248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-18T14:34:53.800246Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T14:34:53.805952Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we will store those OSINT documents and their embeddings in the `threat_intelligence` database.

To determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider threat actors often search the victim’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actor’s intrusion and any security response. The threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in response to victim defenses. This is sometimes achieved by creating new identities in the environment [T1136] and is often upheld with fake social media profiles [T1585.001] to backstop newly created identities.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And now, we send this augmented prompt to our model:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rag_response = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n    contents=prompt)\n\nrag_response_text = rag_response.text\nprint(rag_response_text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T14:35:44.350410Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T14:35:44.350769Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T14:35:45.889460Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-18T14:35:44.350736Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T14:35:45.888350Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Based on the provided information, the MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with Scattered Spider include: T1598, T1656, T1204, T1219, T1566, T1621, T1657, T1486, T1660, T1583.001, T1589, T1078.002, T1199, T1566.004, T1556.006, T1606, T1484.002, T1078, T1213.002, T1552.001, T1018, T1213.003, T1552.004, T1083, T1538, T1021.007, T1578.002, T1648, T1074, T1530, and T1114, T1136, T1585.001, T1567.002, T1217, T1539.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So it worked, we were given as list of TTPs that are associated with the selected threat group. \n\nAs a last step of this project, we would like to combine previously defined tools for the model with our RAG output.\nWe will pass the generated response from RAG model and use it as an input for our `evaluate_mitre_techniques` function.\n\nWith this workflow we would be able to support Threat Hunting Team to identify emerging threat group activities in previous raised incidents for their client base.\n\nBefore we actually pass the RAG response `rag_response_text` to our model, we would need to parse the output into the list to allow the model to use our function.\n\nTo do so we will prepare a prompt in which we will pass the RAG response.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"extraction_prompt = f\"\"\"\nFrom the following text, extract all MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs (e.g., T1234, T1234.001).\nReturn the results ONLY as a raw JSON list of strings.
